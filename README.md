# Connect64-Android-Game
This project was my first major Android application and was an assignment at the University of West Georgia. Everything in the game (code, interface, levels, etc.) was developed by me, but the fundamental concept was part of the assignment. 

Notes:
  The project is currently only designed for two screen sizes, and may not be compatible with every device. It was specifically designed for the Nexus 7 (2013) and Galaxy S5. I'd recommend the Genymotion emulator for better performance. 
  
  How to Play:
    Since this wasn't a released app, it's missing a proper tutorial. The goal of the game is to fill the board with digits 1-64. Each digit must connect to its consecutive digit(s). 1 must connect to 2, 2 must connect to 1 and 3, etc. Diagonal connections are not allowed. Each stage has a different set of pre-entered digits, which creates the puzzle.
